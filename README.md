### Live Share 

To make it easier for you to follow, I will use the  [**Live Share Extension Pack**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack)

This is a VSCode extension that allows you to share  vscode projects live ! You can interract with my code (open a different file than the one I am working on, copy/paste the content, etc.)

Use it, it's a  great tool ;-)
